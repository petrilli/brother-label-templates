# Bosch-Sortimo Labels

I've [written about the Bosch-Sortimo
system](https://lab.rebma.io/organization/sortimo/). This is all the
labels for the system that I've developed. The dimensions are on that
page, but these templates (`lbx` file) can be used in the Brother
P-Touch Editor directly.

The i-Boxx and L-Boxx labels have numbers in reverse (white on black) on
them. These are intended to be sequential to help with organizing them
within a stack, or for some other part of an inventory system. 

**NOTE**: These are all specified as [Fira
Sans](http://mozilla.github.io/Fira/), as that's the main font I use for
things. You can download it for free from the link.
