# Labels for Aidetek Storage Boxes

I'm a big fan of the [Aidetek storage boxes](https://aidetek.com/), and
use them extensively for surface-mount components. I've made up little
labels for them, which are available here.

| File                 | Usage                                               |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `aidetek-small.lbx`  | For use with the BOXALL-144                         |
| `aidetek-medium.lbx` | For use with the BOX-ALL-48 medium size compartments |
| `aidetek-large.lbx`  | For use with the BOX-ALL-48 large compartments |

I'm sure these will work with other storage compartments in other
designs they have, as it seems like they only have 3 sizes of
compartments, but those are the units I use regularly, so they are the
only ones I know well enough.
