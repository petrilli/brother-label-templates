# Brother P-Touch Label Templates

Hopefully, you will find some of this collection of templates for
Brother [P-Touch
Editor](https://www.brother-usa.com/ptouch/ptouch-label-editor-software)
potentially useful. The following categories are included: 

* [General inventory](inventory/) - Just general inventory labels, not
  for any specific system.
* [Aidetek](aidetek/) - For the SMD storage containers that I use, both
  regular and ESD protecting. 
* [Bosch-Sortimo](bosch-sortimo/) - This is for the Sortimo-compatible
  Bosch system, and might work with regular Sortimo as well, but I'm too
  cheap to buy them. It includes labels for L-Boxx, i-Boxx, and labels
  for the sorting containers I've made for the i-Boxx.
